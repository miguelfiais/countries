I improved my React skills while working on this project, especially with hooks like useContext and react-router. Implementing filters for country search was a challenge that helped me learn how to manipulate information and improve the user experience. I also added a Theme Provider for users to choose between light and dark modes. Overall, the project was a valuable experience that helped me consolidate my knowledge and improve my development skills.
